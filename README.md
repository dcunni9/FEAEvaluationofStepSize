## Purpose

In the evaluation of orthopaedic prostheses, analysis is mostly completed using the settings and methods of previous works. However, as new computational methods continue to be explored, an important topic to cover in the optimization of implicit finite element analyses is the effect of time-step size on the accuracy of the analysis. This effort is in an attempt to identify whether or not manual time-step control is a viable possibility in the evaluation of orthopaedic prosthetics. 

## Description
Exibited below are a variety of plots for the purposes of providing an interactive method by which our data might be futher explored.

## Conclusion
The precedent methods of evaluating the efficacy of humeral prosthetics may not fully assess the stress state developed in the humerus when applying a limited number for force profiles. The results of this investigation show differences in the resultant stresses developed in the proximal humerus during physiologically relevant activities. It is therefore suggested that future work utilize a larger loading profile than simple abduction, particularly for the assessment of these implants.
